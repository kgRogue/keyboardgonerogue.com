[{"content":"How will I build this? Building this project will be an exciting journey, and I want to share every step of it with you. Here’s how I plan to approach it:\nOpen Source and GitHub I believe in the power of open source. Therefore, all the code for this project will be available on GitHub. You can follow along, contribute, or even fork the repository to create your own version. The repository will be public, ensuring transparency and collaboration.\nLicensing While the code will be free for personal use, I want to restrict commercial use. After some research, I found that the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International (CC BY-NC 4.0) license is a good fit. This license allows others to remix, tweak, and build upon the work non-commercially, and although their new works must also acknowledge me and be non-commercial, they don’t have to license their derivative works on the same terms.\nDocumentation and Recording Writing blog posts can be tiresome, and I often forget the nuances of what I did. To combat this, I will record my screen while working on the project. This will help me keep track of all the details and provide a comprehensive overview of the development process. Later, I will compile these recordings into a video, which will serve as a detailed tutorial and documentation for the project.\nHow will I record everything? Recording the development process is crucial for creating detailed documentation and tutorials. Initially, I considered using screen recording software, but I encountered several challenges:\nChallenges with Screen Recording Software File Size: The file sizes were enormous, making it impractical to store and manage the recordings. Battery and Space Constraints: Continuous recording drained my laptop\u0026rsquo;s battery quickly and consumed a significant amount of storage space. Inactivity Issues: Keeping the recording software active for long periods was not feasible due to the above constraints. Exploring Rewind.ai I then explored Rewind.ai, which seemed promising. It recorded everything seamlessly, and I didn\u0026rsquo;t need the search functionality, just the playback. However, I faced some issues:\nFile Storage: I found a blog post that broke down Rewind.ai\u0026rsquo;s internal workings and discovered where it stored the videos. Link File Naming: The video files had non-descriptive names, making it difficult to identify specific recordings. File Chunks: Rewind.ai stored videos in chunks, requiring me to merge them before compiling the final video. Considering these steps, I realized that using Rewind.ai would involve significant post-processing work, such as merging files and compiling the video. This process would be almost as time-consuming as writing a detailed blog post. What did I choose?

After some searching and ideation, I\u0026rsquo;ve decided to start with a URL shortener. This project is frequently mentioned in system design interview books and serves as a great starting point for several reasons:\nGood Starting Point A URL shortener is a classic project that covers many fundamental concepts in system design. It\u0026rsquo;s a great way to get hands-on experience with these concepts. By working on a URL shortener, I will delve into areas such as:\nDatabase Design: Understanding how to store and retrieve shortened URLs efficiently. This involves choosing the right database (SQL vs. NoSQL), designing the schema, and optimizing for quick lookups. Hashing Algorithms: Learning how to generate unique short codes for URLs. This includes exploring different hashing techniques and ensuring that the generated codes are unique and collision-free. Redirection Mechanisms: Implementing the logic to redirect users from the short URL to the original URL. This requires setting up a web server and handling HTTP requests and responses. Scalability: Considering how to handle a large number of requests and ensuring the system can scale as usage grows. This involves load balancing, caching strategies, and possibly distributed systems. Small Project It\u0026rsquo;s a relatively small project, making it manageable and less overwhelming for a first project. This allows for a focused approach to learning and implementation. The scope of a URL shortener can be easily defined, and it doesn\u0026rsquo;t require a massive codebase to get started. This makes it an excellent choice for someone looking to build confidence and gain momentum in their coding journey.\nUtility for Side Projects A URL shortener can be incredibly useful for my other side projects. It provides a practical tool that I can integrate into various applications. For instance:\nMarketing Campaigns: Shortened URLs can be used to track the performance of different marketing campaigns. By appending unique identifiers to the URLs, I can measure the effectiveness of each campaign. Social Media: They are perfect for sharing links on platforms with character limits. Shortened URLs make it easier to share content without taking up too much space. Analytics: By integrating analytics, I can gather data on how often and where the shortened URLs are being accessed. This can provide valuable insights into user behavior and engagement. Scalability The problem statement of a URL shortener is multilayered. It can be as simple or as complex as one wants it to be. This flexibility allows for incremental development and learning. Starting with a basic version, I can gradually add more features such as:\nCustom Short URLs: Allowing users to create custom short links. This adds a personal touch and can be useful for branding purposes. Expiration Dates: Adding functionality to set expiration dates for short URLs. This ensures that links are only active for a specified period, which can be useful for time-sensitive content. User Authentication: Implementing user accounts to manage their shortened URLs. This involves setting up a user authentication system and providing a dashboard for users to view and manage their links. Analytics Dashboard: Providing users with insights into the usage of their short URLs. This can include metrics such as click counts, geographic distribution, and referral sources. Micro SaaS Potential The ultimate goal is to develop this into a micro SaaS. This adds an entrepreneurial aspect to the project, providing motivation and a clear end goal. By turning the URL shortener into a micro SaaS, I can explore:\nMonetization Strategies: Offering premium features such as custom domains, detailed analytics, and API access. This can provide a steady revenue stream and make the project financially sustainable. User Management: Building a robust user management system to handle subscriptions and payments. This involves integrating with payment gateways and ensuring secure handling of user data. Marketing and Growth: Learning how to market the service and grow a user base. This includes creating a marketing plan, leveraging social media, and possibly running ad campaigns. Conclusion In conclusion, a URL shortener is an ideal project to start with due to its educational value, practical utility, and potential for scalability and monetization. It provides a comprehensive learning experience while also being a useful tool that can be expanded into a full-fledged micro SaaS. This project will not only enhance my technical skills but also give me insights into product development and entrepreneurship.\nBy starting with a URL shortener, I am setting myself up for a journey of continuous learning and growth. The project is small enough to be manageable but complex enough to provide valuable lessons. It is a stepping stone towards more ambitious projects and a potential micro SaaS that can generate revenue and provide real value to users.\nNext In the upcoming post, I will delve into the specifics of my plan for constructing this project, along with the necessary prerequisites.
